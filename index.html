            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.
                Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary
                school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Renaissance in Europe ushered in a new age of scientific and
                intellectual inquiry and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, Johannes
                Gutenberg developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The
                European Age of Empires saw European ideas of education in philosophy,religion, arts and sciences
                spread out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other
                civilizations â€“ as with the Jesuit China missions who played a significant role in the transmission of
                knowledge, science, and culture between China and Europe, translating works from Europe like Euclid's
                Elements for Chinese scholars and the thoughts of Confucius for European audiences. The Enlightenment
                saw the emergence of a more secular educational outlook in Europe. Much of modern traditional Western
                and Eastern education is based on the Prussian education system.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">is is ISCED level 1. Primary (or elementary) education consists of
                the first four to seven years of formal, structured education. In general, primary education consists of
                six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of five to seven, although this varies between, and
                sometimes within, countries. Globally, in 2008, around 89% of children aged six to twelve were enrolled
                in primary education, and this proportion was rising.Under the Education For All programs driven by
                UNESCO, most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015,
                and in many countries, it is compulsory. The division between primary and secondary education is
                somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. Some education
                systems have separate middle schools, with the transition to the final stage of secondary education
                taking place at around the age of fifteen. Schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred
                to as primary schools or elementary schools. Primary schools are often subdivided into infant schools
                and junior schools.</p>
